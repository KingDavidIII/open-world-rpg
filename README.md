# Open World RPG

A production-quality open-world role-playing game written in Python.

The project is being developed incrementally with clean architecture,
deterministic world generation, explicit application lifecycles, testable
gameplay systems, and persistent save support.

## Current milestone

**v0.4.0 - World Foundation**

The world foundation includes:

- Deterministic world, chunk, region, and local coordinate models
- Negative-coordinate-safe spatial conversion
- World identity, metadata, and lifecycle
- Deterministic integer-only world calendar and clock
- Stable BLAKE2b generation keys for regions and chunks
- Immutable WorldSpecification and WorldModel aggregate
- Controlled WorldRuntime mutation and revision tracking
- World lifecycle and time events
- Engine-integrated WorldSubsystem
- Region and chunk lifecycle metadata
- Deterministic RegionChunkIndex ordering and boundaries
- Structured world diagnostics
- End-to-end application, engine, and world acceptance coverage
- 1,091 passing tests with 100% statement and branch coverage

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Git
- A Python virtual environment

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

## Running the project

Run the package module:

    python -m open_world_rpg

Or use the installed command:

    open-world-rpg

## Quality checks

    python -m ruff format .
    python -m ruff check .
    python -m ruff format --check .
    python -m mypy
    python -m pytest
    git diff --check

## Development status

The project is under active development. The current executable confirms that
the package, module entry point, installed CLI command, and development tooling
are functioning correctly.
