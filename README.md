# Open World RPG

A production-quality open-world role-playing game written in Python.

The project is being developed incrementally with clean architecture,
deterministic world generation, explicit application lifecycles, testable
gameplay systems, and persistent save support.

## Current milestone

**v0.2.0 - Core Architecture**

The core architecture includes:

- Immutable and strictly validated runtime configuration
- Deterministic world-seed configuration
- Explicit application bootstrap and lifecycle management
- Runtime session identity and controlled state transitions
- Structured JSON runtime diagnostics
- Safe runtime directory and save-slot management
- Atomic UTF-8 save-file writes
- Versioned save-game documents
- Strict save corruption and compatibility detection
- Save-document repository operations
- Application-level save and load services
- Resumable session restoration
- End-to-end save, load, and restoration integration tests

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Git
- A Python virtual environment

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment:

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

## Running the project

Run the package module:

    python -m open_world_rpg

Or use the installed command:

    open-world-rpg

## Quality checks

    python -m ruff format .
    python -m ruff check .
    python -m ruff format --check .
    python -m mypy
    python -m pytest
    git diff --check

## Development status

The project is under active development. The current executable confirms that
the package, module entry point, installed CLI command, and development tooling
are functioning correctly.
